# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course

This repository contains the code and the material for the course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" at the University of Tehran. The course is taught by [Dr. Ahmad Kalhor](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~akalhor). 

Implementation of about 15 papers in the field of deep learning and neural networks is included in this repository. 

## Projects

### **Fully Connected Neural Network**
This repository explores Neural Networks & Deep Learning with code for McCulloch-Pitts, Adaline, Madaline, Deep Autoencoders & Multi-Layer Perceptrons. It tackles classification (Iris, Moons) & clustering (MNIST) tasks.

### **Convolutional Neural Network**
This repository implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. Train models to recognize facial expressions (AlexNet, VGG16, MobileNet) and detect Covid-19 from X-ray images.

### **SAM & Faster RCNN**
This repository tackles object segmentation and detection using deep learning. It implements Segment Anything Model (SAM) for segmenting water bodies in satellite imagery and Faster R-CNN for detecting fire and smoke in wildfire images.

### **LSTM**
This repository implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and their variants for time series forecasting and sentiment analysis. It uses PyTorch to implement LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM for time series prediction, and LSTM, 2-Layer LSTM, CNN + 2-Layer LSTM for classifying suicidal vs non-suicidal tweets.

### **Transformers**
This repository implements Transformers for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Natural Language Inference (NLI). It uses HuBERT to classify emotions in speech data (ShEMO) and ParsBERT for Natural Language Inference on the FarsTail dataset (Persian).

### **VAE & GAN**
This repository explores Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It implements Control VAE for disentangled representation learning and trains various GAN models (Basic, WGAN, SS-GAN) to generate new data (dSprites, MNIST-like digits).

### **LoRA and Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions**
Implementing LoRA for fine-tuning large language models like RoBERTa & fraud detection in credit card transactions.
